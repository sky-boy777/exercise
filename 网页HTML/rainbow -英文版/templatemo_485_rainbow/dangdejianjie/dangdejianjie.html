				The Communist Party of China was founded in the early 1920s. The first National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) was held on July 23, 1921. The Communist Party of China, for the first time, has put forward a revolutionary programme against imperialism and feudalism, pointing out the objectives of the struggle for the Chinese people and adopting revolutionary methods that the bourgeoisie Democrats have not adopted, which rely on the broad masses of people. The first climax appeared in promoting the Chinese labor movement, and the face of the Chinese revolution was a new one. Under the leadership, influence and promotion of the Communist Party of China, and under the conditions of cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, China set off an anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution. The May 30th Movement in 1925 marked the arrival of a nationwide revolutionary climax. It laid a mass foundation for the revolutionary war against the Northern warlords. The Northern Expedition War was carried out under the slogan of the Communist Party of China against imperialism and feudalism, and members of the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League, together with the advanced figures in the Kuomintang, played a key role in the Northern Expedition. With the victorious march of the Northern Expedition, the Workers and Peasants Movement led by the Party developed rapidly, shaking the foundation of imperialism and feudalism in China. At the crucial moment of the struggle, the revolution was defeated by the rebellion of the big bourgeoisie and the mistake of Chen Duxiu capitulationism within the Communist Party.

				After the defeat of the revolution in 1927, the Communist Party of China carried out the general policy of land revolution and armed uprising in the face of the brutal rule of the new Kuomintang warlords. The Communist Party of China, represented by Mao Zedong, gradually shifted the focus of the Party's work from the city to the countryside, established base areas, opened up a road to encircle the cities in the countryside and seize power by armed forces. The Party led the people in the base areas to establish revolutionary armed forces, workers and peasants, and repeatedly defeated the Kuomintang's military encirclement and suppression campaigns. At the time of the revival of the revolution, the Party's "left-leaning" dogmatism made the Party suffer heavy losses again. As a result of the defeat of the fifth anti-encirclement and suppression struggle, the Red Army was forced to carry out the long March. The Zunyi meeting held on the way of the long March corrected the "left" deviation in the Party, established the leading position of the Marxist line represented by Mao Zedong, and became a turning point in the history of the Party, marking the party's transition from infancy to maturity. Subsequently, the party led the Red Army with unusually strong perseverance, victory over the enemy's encirclement, interception and various difficulties and obstacles, and achieved a great victory in the long March.

				In July 1937, Japanese imperialism launched an all-out war of aggression against China. The Communist Party of China formulated the program of anti-Japanese and national salvation, put forward the line of all-out resistance and the strategic policy of protracted war, and pointed out the way for the victory of anti-Japanese war. The eighth Route Army, the New fourth Army and other anti-Japanese people's armed forces led by the Party went deep into the enemy's rear, mobilized the masses of the people, opened up anti-Japanese base areas behind the enemy lines, and built an anti-Japanese democratic regime. The army and the people in the base area gradually became the mainstay of the War of Resistance against Japan. After the War of Resistance against Japan entered the stage of confrontation, the Party led the army and the people behind the enemy lines and resolutely fought with the Japanese invaders in a bloody battle, and waged a rational, advantageous and disciplined struggle against the anti-Communist compromise and counter-current of the Kuomintang die-hards. After eight years of hard work, the Chinese people finally achieved a great victory in the War of Resistance against Japanese aggression and made indelible contributions to the victory of the international anti-fascist war.

 				4. War of Liberation 1945-1949) at the end of June 1946, the Kuomintang ruling clique brazenly launched an all-out civil war. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the people's Liberation Army thwarted the Kuomintang's military offensive and turned to strategic attack. Liberated areas to carry out land reform movement, the majority of farmers enthusiastically supported the front line. The movement led by the student movement in the Kuomintang areas became the second line in keeping with the people's Liberation War. The "middle line" was bankrupt and the people's Democratic United Front was consolidated and expanded. The Kuomintang government was encircled by the whole people. The Party led the people's Liberation Army in the three major campaigns of Liao and Shen, Huaihai and Pingjin to eliminate the main military forces on which the Kuomintang relied to maintain its reactionary rule. The second Plenary session of the Seventh CPC Central Committee made political and ideological preparations for national victory and the establishment of a new China. The people's Liberation Army fought across the river and liberated Nanjing, declaring the end of the Kuomintang's reactionary rule. The anti-imperialist and anti-feudal new-democratic revolution led by the Communist Party of China achieved great victory.

				The eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, held in September 1956, worked out the correct line for building socialism in an all-round way. The Party's leadership has deviated from the "left" in the problems of class struggle and the speed of economic construction, causing serious setbacks to the cause of social developmentalism and causing three years of economic difficulties. The Party has taken measures to correct the mistakes of the "left", adopted the eight-character policy of "readjusting, consolidating, enriching, and improving" the national economy, and carried out large-scale policy adjustments in political, ideological, cultural, educational, and other fields. However, the "left" errors in the guiding ideology of economic work have not been completely corrected, and the "left" errors in the political, ideological and cultural fields have developed again, which finally led to the "Cultural Revolution" in May 1966.

In the first two years of the new period, the Party has yet to get rid of the serious interference caused by the "left" deviation, and has put forward the policy of "two ones" (we firmly uphold all the decisions made by Chairman Mao and the instructions given by Chairman Mao). We have consistently followed this principle, and the Party's work has been moving forward in the midst of wandering.
